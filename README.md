This is a simple Library Management System built using Java and basic OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. It is a console-based project where a librarian can add or remove books, and members can borrow or return books. The project uses abstract classes, interfaces, method overriding, constructor overloading, and static variables to manage books and users efficiently. This project helped me understand how to apply OOP in a real-world example and improve my Java coding skills.
